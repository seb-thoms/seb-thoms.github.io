In September 2025, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta delivered his final verdict in the landmark Google antitrust case—a legal battle that began when the DOJ filed suit in October 2020. After a nine-week trial in 2023 and months of remedy hearings, the judge confirmed Google's guilt but delivered surprisingly lenient penalties. While Google was found to have illegally monopolized search, it avoided the catastrophic breakup prosecutors demanded, sending its stock soaring 8% on the news.

## Why the trial?

The case centered on Google's violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the 1890 law prohibiting monopolistic practices. The DOJ argued that Google illegally maintained its 90% search market share through exclusive deals, paying Apple alone an estimated $18 billion annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones. These deals actually prevented rivals from gaining necessary scale to compete.

The parallels to Microsoft's browser monopoly case two decades earlier were striking. That trial, which targeted Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer to crush Netscape, ultimately created space for companies like Google to flourish. Now Google faced similar accusations of using its dominance to suffocate competition.

## The Verdict: Lost But Won

The lawyers for DOJ entered remedy hearings with aggressive demands: force Google to sell Chrome, potentially divest Android, and ban all exclusive search deals. They also wanted Google to share its valuable search index, user interaction, and advertising data with competitors.

Judge Mehta's actual ruling was far more modest. Google must end exclusive search contracts but can still pay for non-exclusive default placement. It must share certain search index and user interaction data with "qualified competitors" on commercial terms, but not advertising data which is the real moneymaker. Most importantly, Google keeps Chrome and Android intact. A technical committee will oversee compliance for six years.

## What happened with the Verdict?

The explosive rise of generative AI fundamentally altered this case's trajectory. When the DOJ filed in 2020, Google's search dominance seemed unassailable. By 2025, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's own Gemini had revolutionized information retrieval online.

This shift profoundly influenced Judge Mehta, who noted that "competition is plentiful in the AI space" and that generative AI poses "a threat to the primacy of traditional internet search." Google brilliantly leveraged this narrative, pointing to Microsoft's OpenAI partnership, Meta's AI assistant, and AI-first search alternatives as evidence of thriving competition. The very AI revolution that initially threatened Google became its legal shield against harsher remedies.

## What this means for the consumer?

For consumers, immediate changes will be minimal—no popup screens forcing you to choose a search engine. However, the long-term impact could reshape how you find information online. When searching for flights, hotels, or local restaurants, you might notice specialized services like Tripadvisor, Yelp, or Kayak appearing more prominently in results, rather than Google's own travel and shopping features dominating the top spots. This could give vertical search companies a better chance to compete against Google's integrated services.

Competitors gaining access to Google's data might also improve their search capabilities, though behavioral remedies rarely transform markets dramatically. The ruling sends mixed signals to Big Tech: monopolistic practices have consequences, but courts remain hesitant to break up successful American tech companies amid global competition.

Perhaps most significantly, this case highlights how rapidly evolving technology can outpace legal proceedings. As Google prepares its appeal and AI continues transforming search itself, the battle over search's future will be fought as much in research labs as in courtrooms.
